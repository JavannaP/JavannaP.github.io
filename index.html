              The back-to-back killings in Rogers Park seemed to be as random as
              they were brutal: an elderly man walking his dogs just steps from
              his home on Sunday and then, barely 36 hours later, a young man
              walking blocks away on the Lakefront Trail near Loyola Park.
              Both were shot once in the head, left for dead.
                </p>
            <p>
              But police on Tuesday confirmed what for many residents was their worst fear:
              The same gun was used to shoot both men,
              most likely by the same gunman. Just about every other detail remains a mystery.
            </p>
            <p>
              What is clear is that the killings of Douglass Watts, 73, and Eliyahu Moscowitz, 24,
              have shaken the neighborhood known for its diversity, prompting
              Mayor Rahm Emanuel to urge residents to use caution as they go
              about their daily lives.
            </p>
            <p>
              “To all the residents of the Rogers Park community, your city is
              standing with you, supporting you, at this moment,” Emanuel said
              at a news conference. "I know firsthand the Rogers Park community
              is strong, is resilient and is a supportive community. We need
              those core values and the Police Department needs those core
              values at this time.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Chicago police said Watts and Moscowitz did not appear to know
              each other. Police have not found a motive behind the attacks.
              Nothing was taken from the victims during the shootings.
            </p>

              Chicago police released an image of the suspect in the fatal
              shooting of a 73-year-old man in Rogers Park on Sept. 30, 2018.
              Police have determined the same gun was used in the killing of a
              24-year-old man, just blocks away, on the lakefront path by
              Loyola Park on Oct. 1. (Chicago Police Department)
            </p>
            <p>
              “Given the frequency of these homicides and what we know about the
              investigations, detectives have been working aggressively to
              cultivate leads," police Superintendent Eddie Johnson said.
            </p>
            <p>
              Asked whether police were investigating the shootings as a
              possible hate crime because Watts was gay and Moscowitz an
              observant Jew, Johnson said it was too early to rule anything out.
            </p>
            <p>
              A surveillance video of the suspect in the first attack showed a
              man wearing black pants and a black jacket with a hat and scarf
              pulled over most of his face.
            </p>
            <p>
              As news spread about the shootings, residents of Rogers Park
              organized vigils, community events and even the start of a
              new block club.
            </p>
            <p>
              Reading on Facebook that some residents were too scared to walk by
              themselves to the grocery store, Maciej Radzik offered to drive
              people there in his car.
            </p>
            <p>
              Radzik, who has lived in the neighborhood since 2011, said he is
              frightened by the recent violence but is trying not to let it
              get to him.
            </p>
            <p>
              “These are places that I walk by, I walk through,” Radzik, 45,
              said. “You’re trying to enjoy the neighborhood and make it better
              and you read about stuff like this.”

                In other attempts to create safety in numbers, some Rogers Park
                residents are organizing groups to walk dogs together.
              </p>
              <p>
                To help residents feel safe, police will be increasing patrols,
                saturating the lakefront and surrounding areas in Rogers Park with officers,
                including those on bicycle patrol.
              </p>
              <p>
                Loyola campus police also issued an alert to students and faculty
                warning “the offender in these murder investigations is an
                ongoing threat to the campus area," even though the attacks did
                not happen within the school’s boundaries.
              </p>
              <p>
                While some residents lamented that neighborhood safety
                has gotten worse in recent years, Grace Hussar, 34,
                said she continues to feel safe in her neighborhood and
                encouraged people to remain out and about despite the recent
                violence.
              </p>
              <p>
                She organized an event Tuesday at Loyola Park for neighbors to
                come together, meet one another and talk about the shootings.
              </p>
              <p>
                “When you walk around the neighborhood over the last couple of
                days, everyone seems on edge. No one is lingering,” she said.
                “There’s like this air of panic because nobody knows who did it.”

                At the gathering, residents passed out flyers depicting a
                shooting suspect as Chicago police officers walked through
                the park.

                Long considered one of Chicago’s most diverse neighborhoods,
                Rogers Park is a popular destination for new immigrants from
                Africa, central Asia, the Middle East and other parts of the
                world. It's also home to Loyola University Chicago.
              </p>
              <p> The neighborhood is far from Chicago's most violent communities,
                though the Rogers Park police district — which covers the
                community itself as well as neighboring West Rogers Park and a
                part of Edgewater — has seen a slight jump in homicides over
                the last year.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Through September, and not counting Moscowitz’s slaying, the
                  district had seven homicides compared to five last year,
                  according to official Police Department statistics. Through
                  the same time period, shooting incidents also jumped to 26
                  from 18, the department said. But shooting incidents in the
                  district were still down by double digits when compared to
                  the same periods in 2015, 2014 and 2013, the statistics show.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Aggravated battery crimes, however, have increased by 32
                  percent this year in the district, up from 68 to 90, according
                  to the statistics through September.
