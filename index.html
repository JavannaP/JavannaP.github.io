            The Chicago Police Department (CPD) has a history of controversy, so
            when new situations arise, they only intensify deep-seated issues.
            In August, the Chicago Police Department sparked public outcry in
            the Southside Englewood community after partnering with Norfolk
            Railroad Service to stage a “bait truck.” This is what community
            members called an unmarked truck full of Nike gym shoes, which the
            CPD parked in Englewood. According to Police Supt. Eddie Johnson
            this was a
            <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2018/08/09/us/chicago-bait-trucks-trnd/index.html"> measure to lure
            potential thieves,</a> CNN reported.
          </p>
          <p>
            Afterward, a viral video gained over 600,000 shares and caught the
            attention of rapper Vic Mensa, who staged an “anti-bait truck” event
            giving out free shoes. Mensa has been a public critic of the CPD and
            even clashed with CPD officers at the recent Bud Billiken Parade,
            the nation’s largest African American parade. While serving as Grand
            Marshall, Mensa was accompanied by protesters who held up a sign
            saying: 'Convict Jason Van Dyke.'
          </p>
          <p>
            Jason Van Dyke is a Chicago Police Officer who was just convicted of
            2nd degree murder and 16 counts of aggravated battery for killing
            Laquan McDonald on October 20, 2014.

            <p>
              This case also gained considerable attention and moved the United
              States Department of Justice (DOJ) to probe into the CPD’s
              questionable tactics. In a <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/1/13/14265262/justice-department-chicago-police-investigation">
                164-page report</a> republished by VOX, the
              DOJ investigated the CPD’s “abusive behavior.”
            </p>
            <p>
              The DOJ wrote: 'Black youth told us that they are routinely called
              pieces of shit’ by CPD officers. A 19-year-old black male reported
              that CPD officers called him a ‘monkey.’ Such statements were
              confirmed by CPD officers.'
            </p>
            <p>
              The DOJ was not the only one moved to action by McDonald’s death.
              Independent journalist Brandon Smith partnered with Chicago
              activist William Calloway to force the CPD to release the
              dashcam footage. Smith filed a Freedom of Information Act request
              (FOIA). When a citizen makes this request, record holders are
              given deadlines on when they are due to respond.
            </p>
            <p>
              After repeatedly asking for extensions, the CPD eventually denied
              Smith’s request. A judge had to force the CPD to release the
              tapes, which led to a peaceful demonstration on Michigan Avenue
              and the DOJ investigation.
            </p>
            <p>
              Seemingly, the CPD considered the impact that the release of the
              tapes had on Chicago, especially on Black Chicago. Before the
              verdict was read on Friday, the Chicago Sun-times reports that the
              CPD <a href="https://chicago.suntimes.com/news/chicago-police-jason-van-dyke-laquan-mcdonald-verdict-4000-officers/https:/chicago.suntimes.com/news/chicago-police-jason-van-dyke-laquan-mcdonald-verdict-4000-officers/">
                deployed </a> over 4,000 officers to various neighborhoods in
              anticipation of riots if Van Dyke was acquitted. Given other
              high-profile acquittals, such as when Officer Darren Wilson was
              acquitted after killing Michael Brown, there was an expectation of
              an acquittal, which, for the CPD, seemed to also accompany an
              expectation of violence.
            </p>
            <p>
              Nonetheless, Rev. Marvin Hunter, McDonald’s uncle who was present
              throughout the trial, made it known that he was not in support of
              violence. 'We’re trying to set precedent here,' he noted in a
              press conference.
            </p>
            <p>
              Calloway, who held a prayer vigil on the first day of arguments,
              called for peace as well. Calloway attended the entire trial and
              has been instrumental in seeking justice for McDonald. In their
              <a href="https://www.wbez.org/shows/16-shots/55c63c72-d518-4ad9-b5dc-dd0d841d79a7">
                '16 shots' podcast,</a> which closely follows the trial, WBEZ reports
              that Calloway was visibly surprised when Van Dyke was found guilty
              and Calloway lost his balance at one point. When he was approached
              by the sheriff, Calloway regained his composure.
            </p>
            <p>
              However, Calloway did not hide his opinion on the verdict. Upon
              leaving the courthouse, he captivated bystanders when he
              xclaimed, 'Everything changes after today!'
            </p>
            <p>
              Calloway was speaking directly to nearby officers, and he was not
              the only one who felt like this trial will set a precedent for
              police conduct.
            </p>
            <p>
              'I’m hoping that it opens a lot of eyes in terms of the police
              treating us fairly, and maybe they’ll think twice about being so
              quick to pull the trigger when it comes to African Americans in
              the city of Chicago,' said Rena Shepherd.

              To Calloway and many, Black Chicago was on the stand demanding
              justice for McDonald. 'Today, Black Chicago won,' Calloway said.
