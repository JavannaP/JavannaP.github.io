            <p>
            The Chicago Police Department has a history of controversy,
            and Laquan McDonald's death highlighted these deep-seated issues.
          </p>

            <p> McDonald, a black teenager, was killed by white Chicago police officer
            Jason Van Dyke on Oct. 20, 2014. On Oct. 5, 2018, Van Dyke was found
            guilty of 2nd degree murder and 16 counts of aggravated battery.
            </p>

            <p>
              William Calloway, a Chicago organizer, was instrumental in breaking the story and sat through the trial from beginning to end. While
              leaving the courthouse after the verdict was read, he captivated bystanders with his energy.
            </p>

              <p> "Everything changes after today!" Calloway exclaimed, speaking directly to nearby officers.
                He said that this trial will set a precedent for
              police conduct.
            </p>

            <p>
              After all, this case gained considerable attention and moved the United
              States Department of Justice to probe into the CPD’s
              questionable tactics. In a scathing <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/file/925846/download">
                164-page report</a>, the
              DOJ investigated and condemned the CPD’s reportedly “abusive behavior."
            </p>

                <p>
              The DOJ wrote: "Black youth told us that they are routinely called
              pieces of shit’ by CPD officers. A 19-year-old black male reported
              that CPD officers called him a ‘monkey.’ Such statements were
              confirmed by CPD officers."
            </p>

            <p>
              The DOJ only intervened after Calloway partnered with independent journalist Brandon Smith to force the CPD to release the
              dashcam footage that showed Van Dyke shooting McDonald 16 times as McDonald appeared to walk away.
            </p>

              <p>
              Initially, Smith filed a Freedom of Information Act request. FOIA allows citizens to request public documents, and record holders are
              given deadlines on when they are due to respond.
            </p>

            <p>
              After repeatedly asking for extensions, the CPD denied
              Smith’s request. This led to Smith appealing to a judge, who forced the CPD to release the
              tapes.

              Nonetheless, Rev. Marvin Hunter, McDonald’s uncle who was present
              throughout the trial, made it known that he wanted to get justice
              for his nephew peacefully.
            </p>

              <p>
                "We’re trying to set precedent here," he noted in a
              press conference.
            </p>

            <p>
              Calloway, who held a prayer vigil on the first day of arguments,
              called for peace as well.

              <p> In their <a href="https://www.wbez.org/shows/16-shots/55c63c72-d518-4ad9-b5dc-dd0d841d79a7">
                16 shots podcast,</a> which closely followed the trial, WBEZ reported
              that Calloway lost his balance after hearing the verdict. When he was approached
              by the sheriff, Calloway regained his composure.
            </p>

            <p>
              "I’m hoping that it opens a lot of eyes in terms of the police
              treating us fairly, and maybe they’ll think twice about being so
              quick to pull the trigger when it comes to African Americans in
              the city of Chicago," said Rena Shepherd.
            </p>

            <p>
              To Calloway and many, Black Chicago was on the stand demanding
              justice for McDonald.
            </p>

              <p>
              "Today, Black Chicago won," Calloway said.
