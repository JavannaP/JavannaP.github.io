Recently, Yandy.com removed a Sexy Handmaid costume based on the popular Hulu series <em> The Handmaid’s Tale </em> after critics said
it romanticized the trauma the show intends to highlight.
Yandy also issued an <a href="https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/retailer-yandy-apologizes-for-sexy-handmaids-tale-costume/">
apology</a>.
          </p>

    <p> One thing this controversy reminds us is that spooky season is upon us,
      which means people will likely roll out their most offensive costumes but
      chalk it up to <em> being in the spirit </em>.
</p>

<p>
      Although Yandy removed this costume because it was offensive,
      they have not removed their Pocahontas costumes, despite the fact that
      <a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/true-story-pocahontas-180962649/">
        the story of Pocahontas</a> is not exactly a bedtime tale.
      <p>

        At some point, it seems, the message of Halloween got intertwined with racism and insensitivity.
      To counter that pervasive narrative, here are 6 examples of unproblematic
      costumes that will help you Hallo<em>win</em> this spooky season.
    </p><br>

<p class="heading">
1. Pot Head
</p>
            <figure>
              <img src="Pot-head.png" alt="pothead" class="otherphotos">
              <figcaption>

                </p>
              </figcaption>
            </figure>

              <p> In an homage to all the “pot heads” out there, grab a pot for this simple costume that will humor your friends with a fun play on words. </p>
<p class="requirements"> Requirements: Pot, Head </p>
<p class="protips"> Pro-tip: You can use a flower pot or kitchen pot and get the same effect.</p>

<p class="heading">
2. Ghostin'
</p>
            <figure>
              <img src="Ghosted.png" alt="ghost" class="otherphotos">
              <figcaption>
                <p>
              (Javanna Plummer)
                </p>
              </figcaption>
            </figure>

              <p> Instead of just throwing a sheet on and yelling “Boo!”, modernize a Halloween-favorite
                by adding the final messages people receive before being ghosted, as reported by <a href="https://mashable.com/2016/07/02/ghosting-text-messages/#ciiLJZnvl8qq"> Mashable.</a></p>
<p class="requirements"> Requirements: Sheet, permanent marker ($1 at Dollar Tree)</p>
<p class="protips"> Pro Tip: You can also use the marker to draw the snapchat logo.</p>

<p class="heading">
3. Muva Nature
</p>
            <figure>
              <img src="Mother-Nature.png" alt="natmommy" class="otherphotos">
              <figcaption>
                <p>
              (Javanna Plummer)
                </p>
              </figcaption>
            </figure>

              <p> As all the soon-to-be mothers prepare for the births of their little ones, why not spice up your beautiful belly with some flowers?
                This fun, cost-effective costume will get your friends talking and hopefully give you a pleasant break from the stresses of pregnancy.</p>
<p class="requirements"> Requirements: Pregnant belly, flowers and tape ($3 at Dollar Tree)</p>
<p class="protips"> Fun alternative: You can pay homage to Khaleesi by cutting out dragon pictures to become the "mother of dragons."</p>

<p class="heading">
  4. Facebook
</p>
            <figure>
              <img src="Facebook.png" alt="face-book" class="otherphotos">
              <figcaption>

                </p>
              </figcaption>
            </figure>

              <p>If any of these other costumes have not been convincing enough, why get some cardboard and paint then carry around this “face book” at the Halloween party? It’s an interactive way to take a jab at society’s obsession with social media.
              </p>
<p class="requirements"> Requirements: Cardboard, blue and white paint ($6.72 at <a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Apple-Barrel-Colors-Paint-8-oz/17301368"> Walmart </a>) </em> </p>
<p class="protips"> Pro-tip: Find a permanent marker and add cliché statuses with friends. </p>

<p class="heading">
  5. Relationship Goals
</p>
            <figure>
              <img src="Relationship-Goals.png" alt="#goals" class="otherphotos">
              <figcaption>

              (Javanna Plummer)
                </p>
              </figcaption>
            </figure>

              <p>Aren’t Kim and Kanye <em> hashtag </em> “Goals”? For another fun way to highlight society’s ills, grab a net (that you would use in soccer to score a “goal”) and some construction paper. Then, cut out hearts and paste them on the net (because who does not love posting hearts on the net?) This will be a cheap way to poke fun at a cheap thrill.
              </p>
<p class="requirements"> Requirements: A net ($10.67 at <a href="https://express.google.com/u/0/product/8727740899610601412_13555648156404853525_8175035?utm_source=google_shopping&utm_medium=tu_prop&utm_content=eid-lsjeuxoeqt&gtim=CN__wfL18aPYXxD5wNeAi8PFnRIYsJ-LBSIDVVNEKJCrxN4FMLv78gM&utm_campaign=8175035&gclid=CjwKCAjwgabeBRBuEiwACD4R5iD5f9JWDtom4AJJ3MxrAXvR8i1gG3GZXUR9ut8mqy2LUG7yjBCZVBoCIZ4QAvD_BwE"> Google Express </a>), tape, scissors and construction paper ($3 at Dollar Tree)</p>
<p class="protips"> Pro-tip: Add pictures of a celebrity couple you ship and spice this up.</p>

<p class="heading">

              <p>Halloween is a day to pay homage, so why not pay homage to legendary ballerina Misty Copeland,
